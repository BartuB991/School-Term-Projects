This python program takes inputs from a .txt file and depending on the input, creates a rectangular game grid
which the car will be travelling inside. The program keeps the record of where the car is; again depending
on the input, it travels to the given position. Depending on the commands inside the .txt file, if the car's brush is on,
it paints it's track as it moves. If it's off, it just changes position. If the car reaches the boundaries of the game grid,
it exits the grid and reenters from the opposite side.
