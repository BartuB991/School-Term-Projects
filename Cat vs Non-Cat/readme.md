This program is a two-layer neural network that detects whether the given image belongs to a cat
or not. In this assignment, relatively different from the others, we were given a starter code with some
lines and a detailed description about the infrastructure of the two-layer neural network which also included
the mathematical processes such as; Forward Propagation, Cost Function, Backward Propagation and Updating parameters.
The program has two parts which are called "Train" and "Test" respectively. In the "Train" part, after each iteration,
the program keeps track of the cost function output and plots the loss figure using this data. In the "Test" part, the program
iterates over the images provided and calculates it's own accuracy using the (True Positive Count / Total Sample Count) operation.
